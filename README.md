### Notes

React is a new framework for me as I have never used this before. I attempted the exercise by planning out how to present data in a consistent format and decided on sections for each api with data displayed on cards.   
Had some difficulty with babel starting off tests so abandoned testing to save on time. Testing would included mocking api call and testing success of the call. Also testing components to ensure divs are rendered.
